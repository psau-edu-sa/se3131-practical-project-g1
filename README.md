# Formal specification using Petri Nets

Using petri nets, I have formally characterized the following system
 We have a traffic intersection that regulates four different lanes
 Only certain signals can be green at a specific time and the rest of the signals are red
 Which can be described as follows
 The two signals in lanes 1 can be green at the same time and the rest of the signals are red
 The two signals in lanes 2 can be green at the same time and the rest of the signals are red
 The signal in lane 3 can be green and the rest of the signals can be red
 The signal in lane 4 can be green and the rest of the signals can be red
 Signals must work in the above order
 Signals in lane 5 allow cars to reverse lanes when this does not interfere with another signal
 
 ## Tools
 
 The description should be implemented via any tools that allow the implementation of Petri networks such as this platform
